# Manufacturing-RFQ-Management
A leading Manufacturing Industry wants to develop Middleware Services for handling “Request for Quote” Processing in their organization.
The Maufacturing Industry has a small plant that assembles various types of agriculture machineries. In order to do this, the Industry wants to buy several parts from its suppliers that addresses the machine design, material choices and price expectations. (Assume that the Industry has only 1 plant).
To identify a supplier who can support in providing high quality product with a reasonable price at the point of need, the Industry floats “Request for Quote” (RFQ) to all its suppliers.
Detailed RFQs allow suppliers to prepare accurate quotes that minimize the potential for cost overruns, delivery delays and at the same time meets the product requirements.
The Middleware services of the Manufacturing Firm will have to collate the needs of products/services from its manufacturing Plant. The inputs needed for preparing a comprehensive RFQ must be provided by the services.
The services must also identify the potential suppliers who can provide the required products.
There will also be an Admin Portal, called as “Fabricate” that has to be developed part of this scope that consumes these Microservices and helps the Admin Staffs with needed data for RFQ preparation.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
